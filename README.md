# ChatGPTSpeech
Short java project to allow voice input/output from ChatGPT using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Speech Services and FreeTTS.

Today, I was in search of a fun coding project to occupy my afternoon. Having recently gotten my AZ-900 certification and attended a Microsoft Cloud Native Apps workshop, I knew I wanted to incorporate Azure tools into my project. With the excitement surrounding ChatGPT, I decided to develop a command-line application that allows users to provide spoken input to ChatGPT and receive a generated voice response.

For this project, I utilized the following tools:
Azure Cognitive Speech Service for converting speech to text.
ChatGPT API for generating the response.
FreeTTS (OpenSource) for converting the response text into speech.

While there is room for improvement in the speech output, I was pleasantly surprised by how easily these tools integrated together. I am extremely satisfied with the results!
Built using Maven.
